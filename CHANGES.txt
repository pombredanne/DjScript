PENDING
- Added DJSCRIPT_PRETTIFY config var for prettified js output
- Added exception logging with DJSCRIPT_LOGGER_NAME config var
    which defaults to 'django.request'
- Added DJSCRIPT_GLOBALS_DICT to optionally prepend javascript
    declaration for dictionary in global namespace
- Switched from subprocess.Popen to subprocess.check_output to
    1) use blocking call to ensure file is written before request 
    2) raise exception if stderr occurs (which propagates to log)
